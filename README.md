# Machine Learning Gauge-dependent Density Functionals: A Challenge even in a Fixed Gauge

### Project outline 

This project builds on my BSc research, which identified a key challenge in training convolutional neural networks to predict gauge-dependent electronic properties of finite quantum systems within density functional theory, even when the gauge is fixed. The proposed project will broaden this study to a wider range of quantum systems by modelling larger numbers of electrons, and assessing whether my findings generalise to other machine learning models. The focus is to strengthen my findings through rigorous validation so they are suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

### Computational aspects

I will use the iDEA code (https://idea-org.github.io/) to model a range of finite quantum systems of interacting electrons for a variety of external potentials. These systems provide the training data for the machine learning models. Kernel ridge regression will be used to predict a variety of gauge-dependent and -invariant properties, using the external potential or electron density as input. An automated hyperparameter tuning workflow will ensure each model is optimally trained, enabling a fair and systematic comparison of predictive performance across functionals.
